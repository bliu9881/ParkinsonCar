# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Amplify build container is running out of memory during the build process, causing deployment failures. This feature aims to optimize memory usage during the build process by analyzing current resource consumption, identifying memory-intensive operations, and implementing solutions to reduce memory footprint while maintaining build functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Amplify build process to complete successfully without running out of memory, so that I can deploy my application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Amplify build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without memory exhaustion errors
2. WHEN monitoring build memory usage THEN the system SHALL stay within container memory limits
3. WHEN the build completes THEN the system SHALL produce the same functional output as before optimization

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand what is causing high memory usage during builds, so that I can make informed decisions about optimization strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the build process THEN the system SHALL identify memory-intensive build steps
2. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the system SHALL highlight packages with high memory footprint
3. WHEN reviewing build configuration THEN the system SHALL detect inefficient memory usage patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build configurations that reduce memory consumption, so that builds can run in smaller containers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Node.js memory settings THEN the system SHALL use appropriate heap size limits
2. WHEN processing TypeScript compilation THEN the system SHALL use memory-efficient compiler options
3. WHEN handling dependencies THEN the system SHALL implement strategies to reduce memory overhead

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to handle memory efficiently across different project sizes, so that the solution scales with project growth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building small projects THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory resources
2. WHEN building large projects THEN the system SHALL implement memory management strategies
3. WHEN memory pressure increases THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle resource constraints

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and monitoring of memory usage, so that I can maintain optimal build performance over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build completes THEN the system SHALL log memory usage statistics
2. WHEN memory issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
3. WHEN reviewing build logs THEN the system SHALL include memory optimization recommendations
